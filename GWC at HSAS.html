	<p>Welcome to the Girls Who Code Branch at the High School of American Studies at Lehman College!</p>
	<p>According to the official Girls Who Code website, the official mission of the movement is to "close the gender gap in technology." Currently, 1 in 5 computer science graduates are women.</p>
	<p>There are many potential reasons for the great gender gap in the technology industry. Some experts believe women have developed misconceptions about the industry and what it means to be a computer science engineer.
	In the past, women were not encouraged to explore STEM fields. However, as technology and programming continues to play an integral role in modern society, 
	women will be at a disadvantage if they are not exposed to computer science because a huge number of jobs are being created in the tech industry.</p>
	<p>In this club, female students learn the fundamentals of coding and website design, using the curriculum from Girls Who Code organization. 
	<p id="box">Explore this website to learn more about who we are, what we do, and how you can get involved.<p>

	<p>The Girls Who Code branch at the High School of American Studies was founded in the Spring of 2018.</p>
	<p>Currently, the club has about 20 members. Members are in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. The club meets once a week, every week during the second semester of the school year.</p>
	<p>Although this club branch is comprised of high school students only, the club does have ties with computer science clubs at 
	Lehman College. The club has a strong relationship with Lehman College's WiCS (Women in Computer Science) Club. Throughout the year, 
	members of the GWC branch at Lehman College spend time with female computer science students and take part in events the college hosts for its computer science clubs.</p>
